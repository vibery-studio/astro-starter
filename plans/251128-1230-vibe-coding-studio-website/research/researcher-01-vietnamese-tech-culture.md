## 1. Vietnamese Tech Startup Terminology

### Key Terms & Concepts
- **"Vibe Coding"** - AI-assisted development where developers describe tasks to LLMs; Collins Dictionary Word of Year 2025
- **"Super App"** - Multi-service platform (Shopee, Zalo, Grab model); VNG proven master of this pattern
- **"AI Janitor"** - Developer risk: spending time fixing/verifying AI code instead of designing; concern raised by AIoT Lab VN
- **Tech Worker Demand** - ~500,000 tech workers needed by 2025; STEM education heavily prioritized
- **"Saving Face"** - Fundamental cultural value; indirect communication & diplomatic approach dominates

### Startup Ecosystem Facts
- Strong government support: tax incentives, innovation centers, accelerators (Alpha Startups, Unitus Impact Fund)
- Dual market: Ho Chi Minh City (finance/tech hub) + Hanoi (emerging)
- English fluency high among mid-senior tech professionals
- Generational divide: Young talent (Gen Z/Millennials) prefer transparency, efficiency, casual communication

## 2. Vietnamese Tech Community & Vibe Coding Adoption

### Current State
- **VN Vibe Coding Community** exists; sharing projects, building portfolios, connecting enthusiasts
- **Developer Profile** (Hoang Long, HCMC): Uses Claude (complex tasks), Gemini Pro (Google), ChatGPT (debugging), plus local tools (LunaBase, Bizino AI)
- **Time Savings** - AI cuts work time by 50-67% vs. traditional coding
- **Use Cases** - Small businesses/startups rapid-prototype, test ideas, invest in specialized coding only if proven

### Concerns Raised
- Quality requires coding knowledge; risk of dependency on AI
- Confidential data exposure to AI training pipelines
- Programmers becoming "AI janitors" monitoring/rewriting code
- Need for debugging, design, code-reading skills still critical

## 3. Vietnamese Business Communication Style

### Indirect & Hierarchical
- **Avoid Direct "No"** - Use "maybe," "I will try," "I will think about it"
- **Non-Verbal Cues** - Body language, gestures, silence convey meaning beyond words
- **Titles Matter** - Always use: "Bác" (uncle), "Cô" (aunt), "Ông" (Mr.), "Bà" (Mrs.)
- **Collectivism Over Individualism** - Harmony prioritized; open disagreement avoided

### Generational Shift
- **Young Professionals** - Expect equality, transparency, faster pace
- **Informality** - Millennials/Gen Z more vocal, tech-savvy, prefer openness
- **English Adoption** - Language barrier minimal; international collaboration smooth

### Key Phrases
- **Xin chào** - Hello
- **Cảm ơn** - Thank you

## 4. Vietnamese Tech Company Website Patterns

### Super App Model (Gold Standard)
- **Zalo (VNG)** - Only true WeChat competitor in SE Asia; social-first + mini-apps; strong graphics/entertainment focus
- **Shopee** - E-commerce → Super App (Food, Mart, Wallet, travel, insurance)
- **Grab** - Ride-hailing → Super App (payments with Moca)

### Design & UX Patterns
- **Western Influence** - Most VN agencies copy American/US design trends
- **Localization Critical** - Not just translation; requires cultural adaptation
- **Color Sensitivity** - Feng-shui/Chinese astrology influences owner decisions; avoid colors conflicting with birth years
- **Text Density** - Vietnamese is verbose (longer than English); navigation often cluttered in adaptation

### Language Impact on Design
- Limited font support for Vietnamese diacritics = reduced typography options
- Navigation labeling becomes naturally longer
- Designers must account for character-heavy UX

## 5. Vietnamese Typography Best Practices

### Diacritical Mark Challenges
- **Tone Marks = Meaning** - "chao" = hi, porridge, or pan (based on diacritics)
- **Design Requirements** - Marks must be:
  - Clear, strong, balanced with base letters
  - Non-colliding with adjacent letters
  - Properly spaced (kerning/leading preservation)
  - Accents typically on right side of letters for consistency

### Recommended Fonts

**Sans Serif:**
- **Montserrat** - Versatile, modern, excellent Vietnamese support
- **Open Sans** - Popular, humanist, sharp diacritics, great for online reading
- **Acumin** - 90-font family, strong diacritics, limitless typographic options

**Serif:**
- **Garamond Premier** - Elegant, teardrop horns, elongated diacriticals (literary)
- **Alegreya** - Dynamic, sturdy diacritics, ideal for Vietnamese literary text
